SQLite has been one of the most popular database among software developers for almost two decades. Since its inception in year 2000, it has been the go-to option for building small to medium size applications that don't require a full-blown database like SQL Server or MySQL. The database can be served from the disk directly and does not require any installation.

But what makes SQLite popular among mobile developers is that its pretty light weight, and it comes in-built in both Android and iOS devices. As app developers we require to have a sneak-peek into the database from time to time, to troubleshoot the data-layer. Lets have a look into how we can do this in an Android device from Visual Studio.

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve --watch`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

``` ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```
