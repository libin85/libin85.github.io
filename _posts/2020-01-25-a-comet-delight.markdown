In my last blog, I briefly mentioned that its about time that Xamarin innovates and brings something new and refreshing. I believe I have found what I have been waiting for: Comet! [Comet][comet] is an open source project and its getting ready under the stewardship of [James Clancey][james]. Its an open secret in xamarin community that some of the amazing tools and ideas were originated at his desk. There are also some other amazing devs like Jon and the likes who are actively contributing to this framework.

As it states in the github page,"Comet is an MVU UIToolkit written in C#". It lets you create beautiful user interfaces in an elagant way following the MVU architecture design principles. Comet allows ur to mix and match both native UIControls and Skia controls. The tooklkit is not limited to mobile and can also be used for blazor and UWP apps and many more in the future.

Comet is in its very early stage and there is plenty of work that need to be done, but the future looks very promising. I encourage you to visit the project [github page][comet] and contribute to this amazing framework, you dont get an opportunity to be part of a world class framework/toolkit everyday. For those of you, who might be busy, dont forget to "star" the project in github and show some love.

I hope to write a series of blog talking more about Comet soon.
